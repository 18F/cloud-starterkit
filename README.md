# Agency cloud starter kit

Demonstrate power of cloud websites + Paas or FaaS

## Introduction

This project demonstrates how to iterate from a simple "Hello World" public website to one that has front-end, back-end, and a datastore with an emphasis on
* automation
* transparency
* compliance
* reuse of high-level abstractions

The target cloud service providers (CSPs) are:

* Azure static website and Azure app service
* GSA/18F Federalist and cloud.gov

These target CSPs are not an endorsement of any commercial offers, they only reflect what was readily available for the first iteration.

# Example 1

This example pushes the html: 

``` html
<html><body>
<h1>Hello cloudy world</h1>
</body></html>
```

and demonstrates that there's a verifiable audit log of who changed what when.

## Example 1A: Hello world with Federalist

## Example 1B: Hello world with Azure static websites

See [Example 1 Azure](./example1-azure.md)
